<!-- .github/copilot-instructions.md - guidance for AI coding agents -->

Purpose
-------
This file gives concise, actionable guidance for AI coding assistants working in this repository so they can be immediately productive and make low-risk changes.

Quick summary
-------------
- Framework: Next.js (App Router) using the `app/` directory. Routes are defined by files/folders under `app/` (e.g., `app/blog/page.tsx`, `app/blog/[slug]/`).
- Scripts: use `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm start`, and `npm run lint` (see `package.json`).
- Styling: Tailwind + PostCSS (see `postcss.config.mjs` + `globals.css`).
- TypeScript is enabled. Keep types conservative and prefer small, typed changes.

Big-picture architecture (what matters)
-------------------------------------
- App Router: The site uses the Next.js App Router. Top-level layout is `app/layout.tsx` which wraps pages and contains header/nav/footer.
- Content flow for the blog:
  - `app/blog/page.tsx` imports `posts` from `app/lib/posts` and renders a list. It expects each post to provide { slug, title, summary, date }.
  - Individual articles are routed under `app/blog/[slug]` (dynamic segment).
  - Note: `app/lib/posts.ts` is referenced by `app/blog/page.tsx`. If that module is missing, look for generated content or ask the maintainer — do not invent a new data source without confirmation.

Developer workflows and commands
--------------------------------
- Local dev server: `npm run dev` (Next starts on localhost:3000)
- Build for production: `npm run build` then `npm start`
- Linting: `npm run lint` (uses ESLint configured in `eslint.config.mjs`)

Project-specific conventions and patterns
---------------------------------------
- Routing: Use the `app/` directory and folder-based routing. Dynamic segments use folder names with brackets like `[slug]`.
- Data modules: Small helper modules (e.g., `app/lib/posts`) export plain JS/TS arrays or helper functions consumed directly by pages. Keep these imports relative and colocated under `app/` where possible.
- Styling: Pages use Tailwind classes directly via `className`. Keep components small and prefer semantic markup (see `app/layout.tsx` for nav/header/footer markup).
- Dates: pages convert ISO-like dates with `new Date(post.date)` — preserve this shape when adding posts or data sources.

Concrete examples from the codebase
----------------------------------
- Blog list sorts posts in `app/blog/page.tsx`:

  const sorted = [...posts].sort((a, b) => +new Date(b.date) - +new Date(a.date));

  Each post is rendered like:

  <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>

- Layout wrapper: `app/layout.tsx` provides site chrome. Add global UI pieces here rather than in individual pages.

Integration points & external dependencies
----------------------------------------
- Next.js v16, React 19 — follow Next.js App Router conventions. Avoid mixing pages/ and app/ patterns.
- Tailwind/PostCSS present in `postcss.config.mjs` and `globals.css`.
- No external CMS detected. Posts appear to be a code-side data import; look for `app/lib` or MDX files if adding content.

Editing and PR guidance for AI agents
------------------------------------
- Make minimal, focused edits. Prefer to add small files or adjust an existing helper module rather than broad refactors.
- When adding blog content, prefer adding to the existing `app/lib/posts` module or following whatever pattern is already present. If that file is missing, stop and ask: do you want posts as a JS/TS array, MDX files, or generated at build time?
- Ensure TypeScript types are updated for any public helper exports. Keep changes testable locally with `npm run dev`.

What I could not find / assumptions
----------------------------------
- There is no `.github/` directory or existing `copilot-instructions.md` in the repository — this file is being added.
- `app/lib/posts.ts` is referenced by `app/blog/page.tsx` but was not found at the time of analysis. Assume posts are intended to live in `app/lib/posts.ts` exporting `posts: Array<{slug,title,summary,date}>`. Confirm with maintainer if unsure.

If something is unclear
-----------------------
- Ask the maintainer whether posts are stored as a JS/TS module, MDX files, or generated by some script. Also confirm preferred content format before creating new articles.

Files to inspect when coding
---------------------------
- `package.json` — scripts and dependency versions
- `app/layout.tsx` — site chrome and navigation
- `app/blog/page.tsx` — blog list rendering pattern (sorting, Link usage)
- `postcss.config.mjs`, `globals.css` — styling pipeline

If you update this file
-----------------------
- Keep it short (20–50 lines). Only include concrete, repo-specific guidance that can be discovered from the tree.
